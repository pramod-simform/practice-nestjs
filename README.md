**1. Authentication Module:**
- **API Endpoints:**
  - POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user with email, password, and role.
  - POST /api/auth/login: Log in with email and password to receive JWT token.
  - POST /api/auth/logout: Log out and invalidate JWT token.
  - GET /api/auth/profile: Get user profile information.

**2. Task Module:**
- **API Endpoints:**
  - POST /api/tasks: Create a new task with title, description, deadline, priority, and assigned user.
  - GET /api/tasks/:id: Get details of a specific task by ID.
  - GET /api/tasks: Get a list of tasks based on filtering and sorting criteria (status, priority, deadline, assigned user).
  - PUT /api/tasks/:id: Update details of a task, including title, description, deadline, priority, status, and assigned user.
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id: Delete a task by ID.
  - POST /api/tasks/:id/assign: Assign a task to a specific user.
  - POST /api/tasks/:id/status: Update the status of a task (e.g., in progress, completed).
  
**3. User Management Module:**
- **API Endpoints:**
  - GET /api/users/:id: Get details of a specific user by ID.
  - PUT /api/users/:id: Update user profile information (e.g., name, email, password).

**5. Role-based Permissions Module:**
- Define middleware functions to check user roles and permissions for accessing certain endpoints.
- Implement authorization logic to restrict access to endpoints based on user roles (admin, manager, member).

**6. Error Handling Module:**
- Define error handling middleware to catch and format errors consistently.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different scenarios.

**7. Documentation Module:**
- Generate API documentation using Swagger or Nest.js OpenAPI to provide detailed information about each endpoint, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

**Note:** Ensure to implement input validation and error handling for each API endpoint to enhance security and reliability. Additionally, consider implementing pagination for endpoints that return lists of data to improve performance and user experience.
